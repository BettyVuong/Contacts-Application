Note that for the file modification and creation time is in UTC according to when the file is changed. I chose to use the os.path.getmtime() for both columns in the sql query instead of NOW(). With os.path.getmtime() the time in UTC is ahead of EST by 4 hours so the queries will have a different time zone. For the June query, I was unsure of how to handle the DATEDIFF()/365 since it could be rounded, so if ages differ by seconds it may not be reflected.
